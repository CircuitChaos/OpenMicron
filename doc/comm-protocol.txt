Parameters: 9600 8n1

Read: handshake, read packets, end
Write: handshake, write packets, end

Note that all data written is echoed by the cable itself due to the cable construction (RX and TX on the same line). This echo is not presented here.

Handshake:

1. Write: PROGRAM
3. Read: QX<ACK>
4. Write: <STX>
5. Read: IMICRON<00><01>V100<00><00><ACK>

Read packets:

1. Read request:
   - R
   - two-byte offset (big endian), for example 00 00, 00 10, 00 20, ..., 32 90
   - one-byte length (0x10 = 16 bytes)
2. Read response:
   - W
   - two-byte offset (as above)
   - one-byte length (as above)
   - data
   - one-byte checksum (sum of offset, length and data & 0xff)
   - <ACK>

Write packets:

First, something (some ID?) is read from offset 3B 10. Contents:
02 FF FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Then, write packets occur.

1. Write request:
   - W
   - two-byte offset (big endian)
   - one-byte length (0x10 = 16 bytes)
   - 16 bytes of data
   - one-byte checksum (as above)
   - <ACK>

2. Write response:
   - <ACK>

End:

1. Write: END
2. Read: END<ACK>

Last offset during writing: 0x3290 (12960 bytes).
